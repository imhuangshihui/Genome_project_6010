Identification of long intergenic non-coding RNA involved in osteogenic differenciation from ratsâ€™ 
several tissues using RNA-seq data

The aim of this study was to identify long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) associated with 
osteogenic differentiation from cells from different tissues of the rat using high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and the powerful tool iSeeRNA. RNA-Seq dataset was obtained from 
SHANGHAI BIOTREE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY CO, including two replicates each for cells from 
left muscle, right muscle, vertebra, brain, liver and testicle of rats. The clean reads were aligned 
to a rn6 reference genome by hisat2 and assembled by Cufflinks to identify the known and novel 
transcripts. RPKM values were calculated to screen for differentially expressed RNA. Novel 
lncRNA were screened through iSeeRNA and sebnif based on various filter criteria. Subsequently, 
the underlying function of novel lncRNAs were predicted by functional annotation by Goseq, an R 
package to identify enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and the KEGG pathway enriched by 
KOBAS. A total of xxx RNA differentially expressed in different tissues(xxx mRNA and xxx lncRNA) 
were identified. Among the xxx differentially expressed lincRNA, xxx were known and xxx were 
novel lincRNA. The differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA were enriched into x significant 
pathways, including those for cancer, ECM-receptor interaction, and focal adhesion. Therefore, 
novel lincRNAwere identified and their underlying function predicted, which may provide the 
basis for future analyses of the role of lincRNA in osteoblastic differentiation.
